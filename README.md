This dataset contains 3,276 water quality records with 10 attributes that measure various physical and chemical properties of water samples. These attributes include pH level, hardness, total dissolved solids (TDS), chloramines, sulfate, conductivity, organic carbon, trihalomethanes, and turbidity. The dataset also includes a potability label, indicating whether the water is safe to drink (1 for potable, 0 for non-potable). Some entries contain missing values, particularly in the pH and sulfate columns, reflecting real-world data collection challenges. This dataset is ideal for building machine learning models to predict water potability, studying water quality trends, and understanding the relationship between contaminants and drinking water safety.

Software Requirements: Python 3.8+ Libraries: numpy pandas matplotlib (for visualization) scikit-learn (for preprocessing) miniSom (SOM implementation) Hardware Requirements: A machine with at least 4GB RAM for small datasets. For larger datasets, it is recommended to have 8GB RAM or more.
